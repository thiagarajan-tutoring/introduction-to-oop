# OOP

In this assignment, we'll work with some OOP structures to get a sense of why they are effective and
how Python uses them.

## Objectives
* Become familiar with basic OOP concepts
* Understand the OOP syntax in Python, and why it can allow for effective, re-usable code

## Git
Before you start the assignment, please make sure that you have

1. Accepted the assignment invitation (ask me to get this URL)
2. Set up the assignment repo for yourself


## Assignment
Please implement all functions in `database.py` and `matrix.py`, and make sure that they pass all 
the tests. Tests can be found in `tests_database.py` and `tests_matrix.py`. To run the tests, after
making sure that `pytest` is installed:

* `pytest -v tests_database.py`
* `pytest -v tests_matrix.py`
* To run all tests: `pytest -v tests_*`

For implementing the functions, read the documentation to understand what the function should do, 
and how to go about implementing the functionality. It might also be useful to see what the tests 
are testing for, to see what expected functionality looks like.

Files can also be run as executables, e.g. `python database.py` or `python matrix.py`. However,
the functionality in these files is very minimal - run the tests to make sure your code is correct.
